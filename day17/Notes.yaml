Retry Tests
flaky tests

1. Extend one of the methods (fill / click methods )
    Click <<slowdown>> - best practice
    Wrapper method -> Click after that wait for sometime (retry)
  
2. Retry logic to be customized (custom functions)
    - Check if the test is on retry
    - Call the wrapper method

3. Change the existing test to use the new method.


Abstraction
 100% abstraction - Interface
 Interface IPage{
    openPage
 }
 partial abstractin


 test(){
 
 }

 test(){
 
 }

 test.afterAll() =>{
  createJiraIssue()
 }

 GitHub Actions
 Deployment tools - Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLabs, CircleCI, Bamboo

 Prerequisites
 1. You should have a github account
 2. You need to create a repo (public/private)
 3. You need to connect your VS code to that repo
 4. You need to configure the playwright git yaml 
 5. You need to push the code to the github --> GitHub Actions running your code
 6. Download the results and audit!

 Usecase: Every time you push your code to Git repo --> PW code (specific tests that you
 configure) will run on the allocated machines (by github actions) and results will be 
 available to view later.
