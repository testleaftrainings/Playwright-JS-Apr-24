## Operators

JavaScript operators are symbols used to perform operations on operands.

- *Arithmetic Operators*: Perform arithmetic on numbers (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
- *Comparison Operators*: Compare two values and return a boolean (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
- *Logical Operators*: Used to determine the logic between variables or values (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
- *Assignment Operators*: Assign values to JavaScript variables (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).

## Conditional Statements

Control the flow of code based on conditions.

- *if statement*: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- *else statement*: Executes a block of code if the same condition is false.
- *else if statement*: Specifies a new condition to test if the first condition is false.
- *switch statement*: Specifies many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

## Looping Statements

Execute a block of code a number of times.

- *for loop*: Loops through a block of code a number of times.
- *while loop*: Loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- *do...while loop*: Also loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true, but executes the code block once before checking the condition.
- *for...in loop*: Loops through the properties of an object.
- *for...of loop*: Loops over iterable objects (like Arrays, Strings).

## String and Its Methods

Represents a sequence of characters.

- Methods include `.length`, `.charAt()`, `.indexOf()`, `.toUpperCase()`, `.toLowerCase()`, `.substring()`, `.slice()`, `.split()`, `.replace()`, and more.
